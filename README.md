# MusicQ

* Application only runs locally on Ajit's machine as we needed to validate his SHA1 key when registering Spotify API as well as the Android Studio Project itself.
* For this current iteration, it only works for an existing playlist, as you have to enter the URI code for the existing playlist for you to produce any music. If wrong code is entered nothing will play and **YOU WILL NOT RECIEVE A NOTIFICATION SAYING THE CODE WAS INCORRECT** so it is important to make sure you copy it over from Spotify exactly. 
* When creating the "code" that you use as your password for QRoom, make sure you use an **int** value as the app will crash if anything else is inputed.
